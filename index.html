 <p>Hi, I'm Charlotte and I'm from Hong Kong.
 <br>Here are some facts about me:
 <br>- I studied a BA degree in History of Art at The Courtauld Institute of Art in London.
 <br>- I like learning about both history and art, as well as swimming and painting when I can.
 <br>- I also recently finished reading a book called <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>.</p>
